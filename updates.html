            <p> TL;DR: </p>
            <p> - There has been lots of progress for Phase 1 and 2  (Mindtype) </p>
            <p> - Machine learning workshops have started! </p>
            <p> - The prototype for the first EMG workshop project has been planned and the design process has started </p>

            <br>&nbsp;</br>

            <p>Hey guys,</p>

            <p>This week, all teams have been putting in work for their respective projects. The user interface has been completed for the P300 Speller and the Phase 1 team is continuing to work on classification with the addition of configuring the docker. Phase 2's progress has been steady; the data extraction and Fast Fourier Transform algorithms have been implemented. The next step will be polishing the training algorithm as well as acquiring better test data. Phase 3 has yet to be worked on.  </p>

            <p>Workshops have recently commenced and the current focus is on Machine Learning. These are meant to help people learn and get hands on experience in a relaxed, fun environment. A project (using EMG) has already been planned and the prototype has been designed. There will be many other projects to come with the start of this school year! </p>

        
            <br>&nbsp;</br>
            <p>Until next time,</p>

            <h3> July 24, 2017 </h3>

            <p> TL;DR: </p>
            <p> - The entire Mindtype project structure and timeline was readjusted </p>
            <p> - We Will begin to start project videos</p>

            <br>&nbsp;</br>

            <p> Hello again everyone! </p>

            <p> Since last time, we’ve been making changes to projects, planning and workspace. Mindtype will now be restructured into three phases, two of which are the P300 Speller and Binary Motor Classification. This will allow work to be done simultaneously on 3 different (but overlapping) projects, from which we will choose one to submit for the NeurotechX Student Clubs Competition.  </p>

            <p> As of now, the Biosignals board team has begun finalizing the design of the PCB board and are aiming to combine the digital and software components of the project. We are currently aiming to gain access to more lab spaces and equipment from the engineering department.  </p>

            <p> The process of creating our project videos has begun! We will be covering both the main projects (used in the NeurotechX Student Clubs Competition) and many other aspects of what progress we’ve reached this year. We’ve also started planning out what NeurotechUofT is going to do for the 2017-2018 year, so make sure to check us out at the Clubs Fair in the Fall!  </p>



            <p> Until next time, </p>

            <h3>July 2, 2017</h3>

            <p>TL;DR</p>
            <P> - We presented the completed/working components of our Mindtype project at BrainBrowse on June 30 </P>
            <p> - We are still currently working on both Mindtype and Biosignals Board</p>
            <p> - There will be a finalized project plan for EmotionLearn by Mid-July</p>

            <br>&nbsp;</br>

            <p> Hey guys! </p>

            <p>We've ended last week presenting MindType at the BrainBrowse event with demos. MingZhi also presented her demo visualizing the brain’s activity in correspondence with EEG signal amplitudes during seizures.  BrainBrowse (run in collaboration with NeurotechX and Toronto Hacker Club) aimed to increase high school students’ exposure to neurotechnology and neuroscience.</p>

            <p>All MindType and Biosignals Board project members have been and will continue working on their respective projects for the upcoming NeurotechX Student Clubs Competition. Mikael got our EEG Hat to work and stream data. The MindType team successfully implemented a multithreaded architecture, and are working to improve the LDA classifier’s accuracy. The Biosignals Board team booted up the ADS chip, and are working primarily with the OpenBCI to test their code.
</p>
            <p>Plans are also underway for our second project, EmotionLearn. EmotionLearn is our long term project designed to use physiological effects of emotions and mind states (with corresponding EEG data) to improve learning processes for people with learning disabilities (such as ADHD).
</p>
            <p>Additional note: We’re arranging a rock climbing excursion late July, so stay tuned!!!
</p>
            <p> See you all next time! </p>

            <p> TL;DR: </p>
            <p> - Thank you to everyone who attended the NeurotechUofT Fair this past reading week! </p>
            <p> - The Biosignals Board team is back to work on the hardware challenge for the NeurotechX Student Competition </p>
            <p> - WallEEG: Using PyQt for GUI; started working on source localization </p>
            <p> - Our new tutorial series called How to Hack the Brain, with Coffee has been up and running for the past two weeks (see the Events page for time and location details) </p>

            <br>&nbsp;</br>

            <p> Hello readers! </p>

            <p> We here at NeurotechUofT would like to extend a huge thank you to all of the attendees who made it to our fair this past reading week! It was a ton of fun to learn more about current innovations in neurotech through discussion and lectures from experts in the field. The club's ongoing projects are a perfect opportunity for further learning if any of you wish to do some more neuro-hacking. </p>

            <p> The Biosignals Board team is back to work on the hardware challenge for the NeurotechX Student Competition. The guidelines for this year's competition have been released and the project design is being developed further in preparation for it. The plan is to have the VitReous and WallEEG teams work out the non-hardware aspects of the project so that once the distinct parts are complete and bug-free, they can be merged, comprehensive tests can be made, and - time permitting - advanced features can be added. </p>

            <p> As for the Wall-EEG project, the team has decided on using a full Python implementation, with PyQt for the GUI. They have started working on source localizaton and understanding the LORETA algorithm, which will allow us to pinpoint signals from the premotor cortex. The next steps are to write a NumPy implementation of LORETA and further understand the machine learning aspect of the project. </p>

            <p> NeurotechUofT has recently launched a new tutorial series we call <a href="./events/how_to_hack_the_brain_coffee.html">"How to Hack the Brain, with Coffee"</a>. At our weekly meetups, we aim to explore how to pick up and analyze brain activity as measured by EEG signals - in short, how to hack your brain. For information regarding meeting time and location (and in case you have missed the first few meetings), click the link above! All of the material covered at each session is posted there. </p>

            <p> TL;DR: </p>
            <p> - We will be presenting the VitReous project at the WeAreWearables conference on January 25th </p>
            <p> - There is an upcoming field trip to the IBBME Medical Imaging Lab on February 2nd </p>
            <p> - Our first neurotech conference will be held on February 23rd </p>
            <p> - We'll first be doing a trial run with a land-based bot before working on the aerial drone </p>

            <br>&nbsp;</br>

            <p> Hello everyone! </p>

            <p> It has been a while since our last update, and with the arrival of 2017 comes a new and eventful term for us here at NeurotechUofT. There is a lot to share, so keep reading to get the latest team news! </p>

            <p> One event is rapidly approaching this week: the WeAreWearables conference held at the MaRS Discover District Centre! This Wednesday, January 25th, we will be there to present the VitReous project that was first introduced by our team at NeurotechX Student Demo Day this past November. This will be our first time attending and will mark the first year of many more to come! We can't wait to mix and mingle with other tech enthusiasts and see the newest state-of-the-art wearables projects. </p>

            <p> Next comes a field trip on Thursday, February 2nd to the IBBME Medical Imaging Lab which is also located in the MaRS Centre. This lab visit is meant to introduce the NeurotechUofT team to current neuroscience research as well as to develop the team's knowledge of medical imaging technology – a vital tool in research and development in the neuroscience field. </p>

            <p> We will be hosting a neurotech conference on Thursday, February 23rd,  during reading week, at which we will have booths and showcases displaying current neurotech projects as well as professors giving talks about neuroscience research and the status of the neurotech industry. This will be followed by a breakout session, during which we will have discussions with invited researchers and companies. We hope to see you there! </p>

            <p> As promised, we have news to share about our WallEEG project! Before starting to develop the aerial drone, our software and hardware teams are going to do a trial run of the project on a land-based bot. We have recently acquired one such bot and our work meetings will be starting next weekend. Once we have developed a functioning bot with a secure connection to Emotiv, we will begin working on connecting Emotiv to an aerial drone. </p>

            <p> Finally, we are recruiting new team members to fill some executive/administrative team positions. The recruitment form will be shared on this website and our Facebook page shortly, so if you are interested, we encourage you to apply! We are looking forward to meeting all of our new members! </p>

            <p> Thanks for staying tuned! </p>

            <p> TL;DR: </p>
            <p> Two weekends ago we travelled to Montreal to attend Neurotech Demo Day: The Student Edition and had a blast! Now that the biosignals board project has come to a close, we are starting developments on WallEEG: a mind-controlled drone. </p>

            <br>&nbsp;</br>

            <p> Hello everyone! </p>

            <p> Two weekends ago our hardware team travelled to Montreal to attend NeurotechX Demo Day: The Student Edition. They had the long-awaited opportunity to showcase the biosignals board project and the VitReous project that had been under construction since the start of this academic year. It was a ton of fun to mix and mingle with other neurotechnology developers and enthusiasts and to learn more about the various projects occurring at other universities. Congratulations to ETS and McGill for their respective wins in parts 1 and 2 of the competition, and many thanks to NeurotechX, Neuroforce, Dejardins, Hexoskin, Muse, OpenBCI and NeuroSky for making this happen! </p>

            <p> Now that NeurotechX Demo Day has come and passed, work is set to begin on another project planned for the rest of the school year: WallEEG, a mind-controlled drone! More information about this will be shared as progress is made. </p>

            <p> Thanks for keeping up with us! </p>

            <br>&nbsp;</br>

            <p>TL;DR</p>
            <p>- Planning is underway for a mini project that will be the foundation for upcoming workshops </p>
            <p>- The biosignals board team is working on establishing a secure connection between the TGAM chip and Arduino </p>

            <br>&nbsp;</br>

            <p> Hi all, </p>

            <p> With the closing of another week come exciting updates from the hardware and workshops teams at NeurotechUofT! </p>

            <p> Developments are underway for the technical workshops coming up next term. These workshops will be structured around work on a mini project that will record muscle signals from one individual and apply them to another individual as a way to mirror muscle movements. At the moment, the team is sourcing materials and designing the schematics of the circuit board that will be needed for this mini project. In November, testing will begin. </p>

            <p> The hardware team has also been working hard on the biosignals board project that will be challenged in the NeurotechX competition. The circuit diagram that outlines the chip's connection to Arduino is now complete and the circuit itself has been connected. Debugging is the task at hand before dry electrodes can be attached and the chip to Arduino connection is finalized. </p>

            <p> Thanks for reading! </p>

            <p>TL;DR</p>

            <p>-Started the Mindfulness Study (biofeedback-based meditation)</p>
            <p>-WallEEG: noise coming from electrodes; still problems with signal processing algs</p>

            <br>&nbsp;</br>

            <p> Hello there!

            The team has started the Mindfulness Study - a research endeavour that observes different meditation techniques and documents the corresponding biofeedback of study participants. The aim of this study is to create and optimize a program that will allow a user to progress into a meditative state. Brainwave data, blood oxygenation levels, etc. are used to form a picture of individual's mental state, which helps the user meditate better. </p>

            <p> The Wall-EEG mind controlled bot is able to obtain and graph signals from the OpenBCI but noise is still an issue. It has been noticed that the source of the noise is improper electrode-to-skin contact. Furthermore, the OpenBCI GUI processes much better than our team's code. What remains to be done is studying the OpenBCI GUI to find out what processing techniques are used before we start working to improve our own code. We are almost done choosing a technique, and are in the process of testing it in real time. </p>

            <p> Thanks for reading! </p>

            <p>-</p>
            <p>-We have a software team for WallEEG Mind-Controlled Bot!</p>

            <br>&nbsp;</br>

            <p>Hey everyone! We've spent the past two weeks doing lots of admin stuff, and we're excited to say that NeurotechUofT has a lot of exciting things in store for the upcoming year!</p>

            <p>We're diving deep into literature for the Mindfulness Study, and we're planning how to develop our Biosignals Board. These two projects are for November 19th's NeuroTechX Student Competition which will take place in Montreal. We'll also continue WallEEG, but our main focus for the semester is the competition.</p>

            <p>A major problem we faced last year with were massive bugs in our projects. To combat this, we're creating The Secret Lab project. They will design and extensively test experimental techniques that can be used by any of our projects. Right now we're working on a general framework to bridge the OpenBCI, GUIs, and signals processing toolboxes. This could be used in both the Mindfulness Study and the WallEEG projects.</p>

            <p>We're also making new ways to help you become the ultimate neurotech ninja! We will have lots of interactive workshops coming up to introduce you to the various aspects of neurotech. This year we will introduce advanced workshops to help you use the various tools and techniques available. This will include workshops on the OpenBCi, signal processing, etc.</p>

            <p>(talk about field trips)</p>

            <p>On the administrative side, our team's hard at work to build industry partnerships so that we can see all the cool neurotech innovations happening in the real world. The hardware we bought last semester is finally trickling in, and we're really excited to use all of it!</p>
            <p>NEXT STEPS: </p>
            <p>-finish putting the pieces of the bot together!</p>
            <p>-find a cool project to work on for NeurotechX's competition</p>


            <p>That's all for now; stay tuned!</p>

            <h3>March 30, 2016</h3>

            <p>TL;DR</p>

            <p>-Bot Meeting 2: we tried modifying our Python script to run on Mac with mixed results; we're going to try again on Linux</p>
            <p>-We received a 32-bit 8-channel OpenBCI board! :O (Courtesy of <a href="http://www.openbci.com/">OpenBCI</a>, those guys are absolutely amazing &hearts;) </p>
            <p>-thinking of having study/chill sessions in April so we can learn from each other and help each other out; comment your thoughts beloow :D</p>

            <br>&nbsp;</br>

            <p>Hey everyone! Hope you had a great time at BOT MEETING #2!! With all the last submissions and exams crawling around the corner, we'd like to appreciate your effort in joining us for this event. In case you weren't able to make it, here are the highlights!</p>

            <p>We're still having issues getting data from the Muse into our Python script; Sayan couldn't install Linux on his laptop for some weird reason. Luckily a member's Mac came to the rescue and so we tried rewriting our code for Mac but problems came along the way when installing the OSC library. On the bright side we discussed what we should buy for our box of things, but don't worry, we'll keep you posted on that! We also realized that it would be a great idea to start programming the bot to move on the controller's eye blinks before working on concentration/calmness. (This is because muscle signals are very large, and can easily be picked up without doing any signal processing).</p>
            <p>Also, amazing news! <a href="http://www.openbci.com/">OpenBCI</a> is loaning us the 32-bit 8-channel version of the Ganglion board!! It's a research grade board that can take EEG, EMG, ECG, and other signals and output it in a format that programs can read. We're going to be using this, and a full EEG headset to mind-control our bot. (Cool. )</p>
            <p>We're also thinking about having study/chill sessions during our meeting times for April (because we know you're all busy with exams). The idea would be that since a lot of us are taking courses that relate to neurotechnology, we could study and perhaps learn from each other. We could also help each other out on concepts we're stuck in! What do you all think? Comment on the Facebook group!</p>

            <p>PS: Really sorry for the lack of updates between December and now; we were going through lots of administrative stuff and trying to get funding and trying to expand our admin team. Between last December and now, we've held workshops on EEG, signal processing, and neurology, and we're well on our way to make our BCI bot! We also hosted a field trip and had presentations and discussion with one of <a href="http://eplink.ca/">EpLink's</a> labs (Thanks EpLink :D). We got to meet their team and learn about the work they are doing. We got a booth at the UTSU Winter Clubs Fair and had an amazing turnout there. Super excited for what's to come!</p>

            <p>NEXT STEPS: </p>
            <p>-installing Ubuntu (an open source software platform that can run on any device) so that our Python script can pick up data from the Muse and analyze it</p>


            <p>That's all for now! Good luck on exams!!</p>
            <br>&nbsp;</br>

            <p>Best,</p>

            <br>&nbsp;</br>

            <p>First of all, congratulations to everyone for finishing another semester of university! I hope exams went well for all of you, and that you have an awesome break.</p>

            <p>Since our last update, we've done some awesome things! We had a field trip to NeurotechTO's Developing EEG Technologies Meetup, where we learned a bit about the physiological side of BCI and had a great discussion about what we want to achieve with BCI. We also had our Programming Crash Course yesterday, where we learnt the basics of programming and had some really good pizza (thanks to Pizza Pizza! :D). We're also officially a UTSU Club, and we're making lots of progress in securing funds for the projects we have in mind for next semester.</p>

            <p>(Small reminder: we will be using Gitter officially starting January 11th, so get an account and join our room!)</p>

            <p>We have another field trip coming up! The Chill and A-Muse Night will be a relaxing way to celebrate finishing Fall semester, and a nice way to start the Winter semester. The event will take place at Bampot Bohemian House of Tea, and will feature lots of soothing teas, delicious Mediterranean snacks, board games, and (very) comfy pillows! We'll also have our two Muse EEG sets so you can meditate with the Muse Calm app. The event will cost $15 per person. Please <a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/149546102079404/" target="_blank">RSVP here</a> by January 7th (say 'Going' if you can go / 'Can't Go' if you can't go):  </p>

            <p>For those of you who came to the Programming Crash Course, we hope you had fun! <a href="https://prezi.com/m2xn-7jiplxl/programming-crash-course/" target="_blank">Here is the Prezi and exercises we completed.</a> PM me on Facebook or Gitter for suggestions for future events like this. Again, programming isn't something you can learn in one day; it is something that must be practiced over a long time. I posted some resources on the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/1176994042329393/" target="_blank">Programming Crash Course event page</a>.</p>

            <p>In our last meeting, we discussed some of the projects we could develop, and decided that we would start off by making a simple app that graphs EEG signals from the Muse. We decided that we could think of more advanced projects in the future. However, these projects will cost money (and lots of it), and it would be very nice if we could get some of the money for these projects from UTSU and other sources. Therefore, we're working on planning this year's budget, which is necessary for fund applications (and for good administration!). For this, we need to know how much our projects will cost, and therefore what projects we will do. If you have an idea you want to do, please write <a href="http://1drv.ms/1malIBf" target="_blank">a small description like this</a> and send it to <a href="mailto:neurotechuoft@outlook.com">neurotechuoft@outlook.com</a>. Thanks so much!</p>

            <p>That's all for today; hope you all enjoy your break!</p>

            <br>&nbsp;</br>

            <p>-We will have a Programming Crash Course soon! Date and location TBD</p>

            <br>&nbsp;</br>

            <p>We had our second meeting last Monday! Thank you to all of you who came out; we had a great discussion about what projects we want to start off with, and about how to move forward with the group. Check the <a href="http://1drv.ms/1OcIb9p">NeurotechUofT OneNote</a> for meeting notes as usual.</p>

            <p>We're also having a field trip on Thursday! We will go to NeurotechTO's Developing EEG Technologies Meetup, where we will learn about developing BCI's and meet lots of cool people! We will meet at St. George Station, Southbound Platform at 6:00pm, and leave at 6:10pm sharp, and make our way together to the meetup. If you want to go there by yourself, here is the address and map (but it's more fun going as a group! :D) :</p>

            <p>ADDRESS: 106 Front Street East, Suite 200</p>

            <p>For those of you who have never programmed before, or want to review the basics of programming, we will have a Programming Crash Course on Monday December 7, 2015 from 6:00pm to 8:00pm. We will be touching upon the material that is found in a first year Intro to Programming course (ie: CSC108). The notes will be posted online, but we will be going over examples as a group and in pairs, so you'll learn better if you come!</p>

            <p>NOTE: The only way you can master coding is to PRACTICE. We are doing this so that you have a head start with the concepts, so that you can practice over the break in time for next semester when we start working on some basic projects. We will be posting great resources on our website and on this group for your use.</p>

            <p>Facebook has served us decently nicely as a messaging platform, but in the future we want to facilitate conversations for idea generation and helping each other out with projects In general, for strengthening our community in general, and for making the execution of this group easier. For these reasons, we will be using Gitter as our primary tool for online conversation!</p>

            <p>Gitter is an online messaging app which is a part of a larger service called GitHub. We will be using GitHub a lot when we start creating projects, because it is a very useful way of keeping track of how your software changes, and very useful for team software development. (Also, most software employers want to look at your GitHub to see what type of code you've written, so it's a nice way to showcase your work!) Gitter will be useful to us because we can have topic-specific rooms (ie: general, random, ideas, etc) to organize our conversation. To join Gitter, first create a <a href="https://github.com/" target="_blank">GitHub account here</a>. Then take a look at <a href="https://gitter.im/neurotechuoft?utm_source=share-link&utm_medium=link&utm_campaign=share-link" target="_blank">NeurotechUofT's Gitter</a> and join the rooms you want :D . Please join the General room, as we will post all updates and administrative messages there.</p>

            <p>This is all for now, but we will be posting a lot more about some of the things that were mentioned in our last meeting, and about what's coming up next semester.</p>

            <br>&nbsp;</br>

            <h3>November 11, 2015</h3>
            <p>TLDR:</p>

            <p>-check out our <a href="http://1drv.ms/1OATdZa" target="_blank">long-term and short-term goals!</a></p>

            <p>-our first meeting's this Monday! (the 16th) Stay tuned for more details!</p>

            <p>-what we've done: recognition from Ulife, website online, detailed plan for the next month-ish (with help from NeurotechTO)</p>

            <p>-what we're going to do: obtain a Muse from InteraXon for hack night, get bank account, start funding applications</p>

            <p>-if you want to help out with running NeurotechUofT, fill out <a href="http://1drv.ms/1MK3uvB" target="_blank">this short form</a> :D   Your help is very much appreciated!</p>
                    <br>&nbsp;</br>


            <p>It's great to see so many people enthusiastic about the field of neurotech! Thank you all for joining us in our mission to create a lively neurotech community at U of T.</p>

            <p>Also, thank you all to those who responded to the question about what you want to achieve from participating in NeurotechUofT. I read the responses, and used my visions, as well as the visions expressed in the survey, to create long-term and short-term goals for NeurotechUofT. They are stated, and explained in the this <a href="http://1drv.ms/1OATdZa" target="_blank">document!</a> :D</p>

            <p>So far, we've achieved recognition from Ulife, touched base with NeurotechTO (our parent organization in Toronto with the shared goal of creating a neurotech community in Toronto), and have some neat stuff planned for the future. We also have a <a href="http://neurotechuoft.github.io/" target="_blank">website</a> up! (yay :D). Over the next week, we want to open a bank account to a) reduce the chance of a conflict-of-interest situation, and b) to fulfill the requirements needed to apply for UTSU recognition (and funding). We're also going to look into and apply for funding sources. We're shaping up to have a meeting this Monday (the 16th), so stay tuned for more details!</p>

            <p>One last thing: there's a lot of behind-the-scenes work that's essential to keep NeurotechUofT alive and thriving. This includes web development, fund acquisition, organizing workshops, and more. If you're interested in helping out, give us your name, and answer a few questions in <a href="http://1drv.ms/1MK3uvB" target="_blank">this short form</a>! :D It's a great way to gain hands-on experience with operating an organization, and will help you refine your management, administrative, and leadership skills. Your contributions will help NeurotechUofT achieve its goals, and will help create a strong neurotechnology community at U of T. (And you can even add your experience to your resume!)</p>
